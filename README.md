# Langchain
We will study about langchain process.

Langchain consists of Model I\O, Retrieval, Agents, Chains and Extra. There are different packages which are LangChain, LangChain Core, LangChain Community and LangChain Experimental.
We will use langchain package which has LangChain Core and LangChain Experimental.
Learning LangChain has five steps.

Accessing Models(OpenAI, Google AI etc.)
Porcessing chains(create_stuff_documents_chain and create_openai_fn_runnable)
Loaders & Partitioners (WebBaseLoader, CharacterSplitter, PyPDFLoader, RecursiveCharacterSplitter, UnstructuredExcelLoader and SemanticSplitter)
RAG (RAG with URL and RAG with PDF)
Different Embedding Models(cohere and HuggingFace)
